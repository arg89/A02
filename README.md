Task: Define Terms

Definitions:
- Branch: can develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository; can always create a branch from an existing branch; create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.
- Clone: to clone a repository; copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine; cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
- Commit: is similar to saving a file that's been edited; a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch; Git identifies the specific changes like when the changes were made or who created the changes.
- Fetch:  to retrieve new work done by other people; fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.
- GIT: is an open-source distributed version control system that is available for free.
- Github: is a code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration; allows you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- Merge: to combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history; git merge is used to combine two branches.
- Merge Conflict: when people make different changes to the same line of the same file or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file; must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub.
- Push: used to upload local repository content to a remote repository; to transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo; it is the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.
- Pull: used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content; merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration workflows.
- Remote: known as "the place where your code is stored."; usually a URL that could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.
- Repository: contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history; can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
